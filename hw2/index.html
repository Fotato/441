            <p>&emsp;I remember playing Rayman 2: The Great Escape like it was yesterday. There I was sitting behind the glowing screen of my family's desktop computer; the fabric of my very being resonating with excitement; my brow daubed with sweat; my hands on the keyboard ready to blast some robot pirates. Globox needed saving, again, but I was the man to do it--the Rayman you could say.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Razor Beard was still at large and his goons were wreaking havoc across the Glade of Dreams. They were dumping oil in the streams, polluting the air with their diesel spouting machines--even imprisoning whales! What evil skullduggery the pirates had inflicted on the poor fairy world!</p>
            <p>&emsp;But hope was not lost. I had helped Ly escape and she rewarded my bravery with a fistful of raw robot-killing power. I was only a hundred lums short of 100%, but it didn't matter: I was ready to save the world.</p>
