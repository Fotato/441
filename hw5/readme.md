# AI Section:
_**Disclaimer**: I am talking about the secretary section in my story. To get there choose the following options: "Call your job and pretend to be sick" -> "Answer the door"_

I used Google Gemini to help me with my input section. It proved to be incredibly useful since I was building something very specific. While I did not copy the code, I did use it to help with syntax. Gemini usually answers my questions with a few different syntax options which allows me a degree of flexibility. I also benefitted from having to describe my code, since I did not want to input my code into Google, which I believe helped me learn.

Overall, my usage of AI was useful, but it offered really complex alternatives to how I was coding, which was welcome in some instances and less helpful in others. I will say that Gemini has made it abundantly clear that some of my coding techniques are a bit inefficient. This is good to know since I am always trying to improve.
