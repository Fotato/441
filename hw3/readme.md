* What you created

I created a simple html page that utilizes HTML, a little bit of CSS and JavaScript. It creates a few logs in the console. My page also has some fun functionality in regards to the smiley face.

* What the generative AI/someone else created

I used Gemini to help me figure out how to actualize my smiley face functionality. I also used it to explain and give me resources so I could understand why the code worked the way it does. Overall, I'm happy with the result and the learning that I acquired during the process.

I attached my own, non-ai generated, comments to the .js for future reference.

* How would you feel if you relied only on AI-generated output or someone else's work

I would learn nothing. It is important to use it to help break down the barriers of learning, but it is also important to study the code (and web resources like w3schools) so that you can grow as an individual.

* Whether you could adequately explain the code that was written

I can and I have. Check the `script.js` file for my comments.

* Whether the final work still feels like your own

I won't lie, but using AI feels like cheating. I look forward to using it to learn, but I can't wait for the day that I won't need it.
